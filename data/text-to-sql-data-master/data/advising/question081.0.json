        "Technically a yes-or-no question, but pragmatically, if the answer is no, this wants to know who else teaches it. By the way, this is a case where presuppositions help us! The question presupposes that Professor Stout teaches Algorithms. So if we're having trouble deciding which class \"Algorithms\" refers to, we could look for the name of the class that contains Algorithms and is taught by Stout."
