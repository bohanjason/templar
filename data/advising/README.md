# Advising Dataset

The advising dataset was obtained with permission from the Project Sapphire team.

We ran the questions through our Java JSQLParser to obtain 206 valid SQL queries.

## Removed Queries

We then manually removed a few queries for various reasons as listed below.

Because of an invalid reference to table "TEMP":
```
SELECT TEMP.AREA FROM ( SELECT AREAalias0.AREA , COUNT( * ) AS DERIVED_FIELDalias0 FROM AREA AS AREAalias0 INNER JOIN STUDENT_RECORD AS STUDENT_RECORDalias0 ON STUDENT_RECORDalias0.COURSE_ID = AREAalias0.COURSE_ID WHERE STUDENT_ID = 1 AND STUDENT_RECORDalias0.GRADE LIKE "A" GROUP BY AREAalias0.AREA ) AS DERIVED_TABLEalias0 WHERE DERIVED_TABLEalias0.DERIVED_FIELDalias0 = ( SELECT COUNT( * ) AS DERIVED_FIELDalias1 FROM AREAalias1.AREA AS AREAalias1 , STUDENT_RECORD AS
STUDENT_RECORDalias1 WHERE STUDENT_RECORDalias1.COURSE_ID = AREAalias1.COURSE_ID AND STUDENT_RECORDalias1.GRADE LIKE "A" AND STUDENT_RECORDalias1.STUDENT_ID = 1 GROUP BY AREAalias1.AREAalias1 ORDER BY DERIVED_FIELDalias1 DESC LIMIT 1 ) ;
```

```
SELECT DISTINCT COURSEalias0.NAME , COURSEalias0.NUMBER FROM ( SELECT MAX( PROGRAM_COURSEalias1.WORKLOAD ) AS DERIVED_FIELDalias0 FROM PROGRAM_COURSE AS PROGRAM_COURSEalias1 ) AS DERIVED_TABLEalias0 , COURSE AS COURSEalias0 , PROGRAM_COURSE AS PROGRAM_COURSEalias0 WHERE PROGRAM_COURSEalias0.COURSE_ID = COURSEalias0.COURSE_ID AND PROGRAM_COURSEalias0.WORKLOAD = DERIVED_TABLEalias0.DERIVED_FIELDalias0 ;
```
