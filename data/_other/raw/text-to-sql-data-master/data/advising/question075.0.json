        "Again, every yes/no question requires a little bit of reasoning. We could check if the instructor for 482 is p.chen, we could check if 482 is a list of all the courses p.chen is teaching next semester, or we could check if the set of courses that are 482 and have instructor p.chen is non-empty. Our query depends somewhat on our reasoning."
