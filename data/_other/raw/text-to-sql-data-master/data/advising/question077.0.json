        "This type of thing makes me want to have a Lucene component or something else more IR-based. Networks isn't an area. It might or might not appear in the title of a course; it's more likely to appear in the description, but SQL isn't super-awesome at partial matches. Also, this is going to give us every class that mentions \"network\"; IR has spent a long time figuring out better approaches."
