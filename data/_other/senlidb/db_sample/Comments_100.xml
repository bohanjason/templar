And that you actually had not said anything about how this string was meant to be used. Global variables can potentially cause a lot of damage. If you have do something like what you want you should retain the code to a function or class with the specific purpose of doing exactly this. All code should be contained inside this particular construct and should not be possible to modify from outside. If case you do not do this you will likely shoot yourself in the foot sooner or later." CreationDate="2016-05-12T18:13:17.043" UserId="2903371" />

But if you want to have a mutex with `defer`, itâs easy enough (itâs a standard example of using a handle with tryâfinally, and trivially adaptable to `defer`): `m := mutex{}; defer m.unlock(); m.lock();` âÂ I hope I got the Go syntax right: I never use it, but I use the same routinely in R (`defer` there is called `on.exit`)."
